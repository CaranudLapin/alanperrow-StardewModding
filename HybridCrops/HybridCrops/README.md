# Hybrid Crops
An expansion to Stardew Valley that adds the ability to create hybrid crops.

## Progress
### 1.0.0
8/27 - Initial code created. Started developing plan for structure and implementation. Gathering modding resources relevant to what will be necessary for the mod.

## Plan
### Hybrid Seed Maker
Large machine located in Demetrius' lab after completing Hybrid Crops storyline.

Takes in two different types of seeds (and crops, optionally). After some time, has a chance to produce seeds that are a hybrid between both of the input seed types.

Benefits to hybrid crops:
 * Better

Details:
 * Max 5 seeds and 5 crops for both types, per hybrid attempt

### Hybrid Crops Storyline
Quest involving Wizard and Demetrius that provides a backstory leading up to unlocking the main mod content — the ability to create hybrid crops.

Prerequisites:
 * Spring Year 2 or later
 * Friendship with Wizard and Demetrius

### Config
Hybrid Attempt
 * Time needed - for people who don't want to wait
 * Global success chance multiplier - to make succesfully hybriding more/less likely
 * Max amount of input seeds - allows more input seeds and consequently more output seeds
 * Crops count towards output seed amount - makes each input crop provide an additional output seed
 * Additional seed/crop success chance - modify the additional success chance obtained from using multiple seeds/crops
 * Matching seed/crop pair success chance bonus - modify the additional success chance bonus obtained from using matching pair(s) of seeds/crops
Quest Prerequisites
 * have access to the quest without waiting for Year 2, or
 * skip the story and quest entirely, instantly gaining access to hybriding.
